# ETL-Project

Goal of the project is to increase revenue of company using available raw data.
Currently company has huge amount of raw bike ride data across different cities in U.S like Chicago, Boston, New York, New Jersey, Washington DC. They not able to make business decision from it so they hire etl and bi developer to process raw data and develop bi dashboard which is useful to make data driven business decision.

There are three phases for project extract, transform, load.

Extract Phase :- For this project i extracted open source bike trip data for cities in U.S like Chicago,Boston,New York, New Jersey, Washington DC over period 2017-2020.

Transform Phase :- As data is in raw format I have to perform data processing and transformation like handling missing data, removing duplicate data, converting column in proper datatype, deriving some feature using existing feature, merging data etc.

Load Phase :- In this phase I used to load clean data into MySQL database tables. Load data is used for 
bi reporting to find measures like total user count, popular station name, popular trip duration.
• Based on user count company know about target audience so they can provide offer on subscription.
• Popular station name is used to forecast demand for bike or stations. 
• Popular trip duration is used to understand customer usage pattern based on it we can estimate budget for maintenance of bike. 
In this way this project helpful for company to increase revenue of company.
